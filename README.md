# windowman

Scripts for Authotkey 2 to extend Microsofts's lackluster Window Manager experience. Still in development and not recommended to use in this state, but might be a useful reference for your own scripts.

## Features
- Center and Resize windows to preconfigured dimensions on demand
- Automatically hide all background windows when changing window in the tab switcher
- Automatically hide windows of blacklisted applications
